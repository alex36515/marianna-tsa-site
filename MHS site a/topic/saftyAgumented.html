                On the other side of the spectrum, there are a few concerns that have arose around the concept of augmented reality. One of which would of course be the potential for safety hazards due to the user of the A.R technology being susceptible to distracted use. One of the greatest examples of such would be the introduction of a recently popular and viral mobile game that took advantage of the public's love for advanced technology and a popular franchise. That mobile game is of course Pokémon Go. What made this mobile game so unique and popular would be it's revolutionary usage of augmented reality, which made the user feel as though they were actually a part of their favorite childhood television series. The game required the players to go out and explore their surrounding environment while using their phone as somewhat of a lense into the Pokémon world. Players often found themselves going to great lengths in order to "Catch 'em all". Though the game gained a massive following of participants across the nation, many of the players found themselves in bad situations. For example, numerous people have died or have been critically injured while taking a part of this mobile game. Those who played the game have found themselves in car crashes, being hit by oncoming cars while crossing the street, and even robbed at gunpoint, all of which was due to the distraction that the app offered.<br /><br />

                Another problem that has been brought to light surrounding augmented reality is the issue concerning privacy. One feature of some A.R technologies that will soon be offered is facial recognition software that will allow the user of the A.R hardware to access information on random strangers by linking their faces to their many possible online profiles across all types of social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and LinkedIn, all of which by simply pointing a phone or headset in someone's direction.<br /><br />

                The problem with this is obvious; anyone can can have access to information about you and your social life without your consent. This of course could lead to a number of malicious activities such as stalking, and possibly robbery. Between distracted use and a possible violation of privacy, it is clear to see why some have concerns regarding augmented reality.<br /><br />
